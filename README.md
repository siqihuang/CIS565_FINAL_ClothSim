GPU-Based Cloth Simulation
================

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Final Project**

* Ziye Zhou & Siqi Huang

Progress
========================
### Project Overview

### MileStone1
Progress:

1. finish implementing force based integration method (explicit euler, RK2, RK4) 

2. finish implementing position based integration method

3. finish implementing simple primitive collision detection and resolve method

Next step:

1. implicit method (require using cuSolver to solve linear system with sparse matrix)

2. AABB tree collision detection and resolve using imported obj file

3. more advanced integration method (projective dynamics)

4. new simulation effect (tear apart, etc)
